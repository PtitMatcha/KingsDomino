We have also built an AI capable of playing by the rules to allow
players to play on their own.

A Domi’Nations game allows 2 to 4 players to participate. Each player using
dominoes to build his kingdom of size 5x5.

* 48 dominoes (with one landscape side, one numbered side)

These dominoes each have two portions of land, some portions have a certain
crown number.
A certain number of dominoes are used depending on the number of player each player has
one or two kings, during each turn the players choose dominoes and place them in
their land. When all the dominoes have been placed, the player with the highest score wins.
The more detailed process will be developed in the following parts.
